Login -
    In the initial page you are directed to the log in page. Here you can either log in with your username and password or create a new account with the register button on the top right hand side.

Index -
    In the index page, you are presented with a table that shows the user all of the parties that have been created. In the table, information about party name, location, date/time, and host can be found. Furthermore, on this page(like in all pages) you can find a "Make party" tab, a "RSVP" tab, a "map" tab, and a RSVP info tab.

Make -
    On the make page, you are presented with a form to make a new party. On this page you have a text field for the name of the party, a datetime field for the date, a text field for the dorm/house where the party will be held, and the roomnumber. (Note, the format of the date/time field is month/day/year hour:minute AM/PM)

RSVP -
    On this RSVP page you can select a name of a party from a drop down list and fill in a text field box asking for an item that they would want to bring to the party.
Map -
    This map page is a bit more complex. On this page, there is essentially on a map. The map is zoomed on the Harvard yard and, if a party has been registered in the yard, will have party emojis as markers to indicate the location of a party. On the empji marker, there will be a number which indicates the number of parties being held in that dorm.
RSVP info -
    On the rsvp info page one can select a party to see the rsvp list of said party. One selected, the user will be taken to another page with table of all of the people attending the party and what they are bringing.
Change password -
    On this page, the user has a password field and a submit button to change their password.
Logout -
    A button to log out.

Compiling and running -
    In order to compile and run my program one will need all of the files are currently held in the file titled "Final." In this file, all of the html files can be found, along with application.py, the database, helpers.py, and a few images. In order to run my webpage one only needs to enter "run flask" in the compiler while in the "final" directory in the terminal.
